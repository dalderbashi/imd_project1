In this study, we are interested in what major employers are in the metro Richmond area, where they are located as indicated by zip code and whether there are associations with adjoining poverty, salary rates, and home values.
In addition, we consider the overall types of employers in the Greater Richmond, as an indicator for those likely to hire data analysts or IT professionals. We also compare the connection to the "2018 Best Places to Work" as determined from the Richmond Times Digest annual survey to the largest private employers in the region.
Initial Research Questions:
   *	What is the economic "backdrop" for economic development in the Richmond area, based on demographics? Where are the highs/lows?
   *	What businesses form the economic basis of the Richmond Area?
   *	Are there clear relationships between the presence of businesses and the demographics of surrounding areas?
   *	Where might there be opportunities for business development?
   *	Which business lines are likely to require data analysts and IT professionals?
   *	Is there a connection between the largest employers and best places to work?

We started with 92 zipcodes for the Richmond MSA, but after analyzing the data we realized there are missing values or insufficient information. After data clean-up we ended up with 86 zipcodes. We chose to focus on zipcodes as it our opinion it usually presents the neighborhood boundaries where people tend to live, shop, and sometimes work. Research Questions
